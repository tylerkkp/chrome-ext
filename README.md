Testing out building a Chrome Extension. Simple popup with links

### Frontend Development Toolbar

The purpose of this is mainly to get comfortable building Chrome Extensions. However, this will have the added functionality of cleaning up my browser bar. I can hide my 'bookmarks' toolbar, and have all of my important links in this popup. 

Future Functionality

* User accounts with Google
* Ability to add/remove/edit items in popup
* Settings (background image, themes)
* Editable tabs for organizing bookmarks (coding, writing, media, gaming, productivity, etc)
